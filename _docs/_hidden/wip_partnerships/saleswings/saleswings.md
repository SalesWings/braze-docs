### Lead, Contact, Account and Opportunity grading

SalesWings allows braze customers to qualify leads and accounts based on profile data (typically CRM data). This is also referred to as ‚Äúlead grading‚Äù, ‚Äúfit scoring‚Äù or ‚Äúfirmographic scoring‚Äù. Braze customers can send attribute data directly to SalesWings, and SalesWings has the ability to read any Salesforce CRM standard or custom objects data and records, for a holistic profile scoring.

### Sales insights and intelligence for sales reps

SalesWings enables braze customers to show your sales reps intuitive sales insights about their leads, contacts and accounts. In a visual, intuitive and fully automated way, SalesWings summarises key insights such as a lead‚Äôs or account‚Äôs interests, sales readiness, detailed engagement with braze emails, other marketing campaigns and content, along with the full lead‚Äôs journey. Essentially, you can surface any braze and web engagement data to your sales team. The insights are natively embedded into Salesforce CRM, and can also be pushed to other CRM‚Äôs or systems, or via a braze email as a ‚Äúsales alert‚Äù.

### Step 4: Identifying leads on your website / app

#### Ways to identify leads and trigger lead scoring with braze and SalesWings

To trigger lead scoring and the creation of sales insights, a lead must first be identified on your website or app by SalesWings - just like with other common B2B marketing automation solutions.
In order to identify leads on your website and initiate behavioral scoring, we have to first resolve their identity on the website. This can occur in 4 ways:

1. Form submissions
  - A lead (‚Äúuser‚Äù) submits a web form: The SalesWings javascript will automatically identify all of your web forms (i.e. login, download, contact us etc), and resolve the identity of a lead (‚Äùuser‚Äù) when they submit such a form. Key is that the web form has an ‚Äúemail‚Äù field, which is used as a key ID in SalesWings
2. Segment.com Identify event (optional)
  - If you are a Segment.com user, you can also resolve the identity of a lead with our Segment.com integration
3. Sales email tracking via Gmail and Outlook plugins (optional)
  - If you decide to empower your sales reps with our email tracking plugins, they are able to trigger full website tracking of leads by sending them trackable links.
4. URL link clicks with braze ID or external ID
  - A lead clicks on a braze marketing action, typically email clicks, banner clicks, or similar, leading to a page which you are tracking with the SalesWings tracking script
  - See guide below how to achieve this:

#### Identifying leads from URL clicks

You can identify leads automatically when they click on a ‚Äútrackable‚Äù URL, for example via email blasts, banners with URL‚Äôs, or else.

In order to make a URL trackable:

1. Modify your URL links going to your website in your emails, banners, SMS, or other places
2. Add the following parameter and ID at the end of your links (just like UTM‚Äôs)

Option 1: **braze_id** parameter:
  - `?braze_id=` followed by the ‚ÄúPersonalization‚Äù variable {% raw %}`{{${braze_id}}}`{% endraw %}
  - The variable here is the standard ‚Äúbraze ID‚Äù
  - Example of final link: {% raw %}`https://www.your-website.com?braze_id={{${braze_id}}}`{% endraw %}

Option 2: **br_user_id** parameter:
  - `?br_user_id=` followed by the ‚ÄúPersonalization‚Äù variable {% raw %}`{{${user_id}}}`{% endraw %}
  - The variable here is your customizable ‚Äúexternal ID‚Äù
  - Example of final link: {% raw %}`https://www.client-website.com?br_user_id={{${user_id}}}`{% endraw %}

The **braze_id** personalization variable is set to a permanent identifier of the user generated by braze and is always available. The **user_id** personalization variable is set to the identifier of the user in your system and might be missing in certain scenarios (e.g., for anonymous users created by braze SDK). If both **braze_id** and **br_user_id** are used in a link, SalesWings will consider only **braze_id** parameter.
